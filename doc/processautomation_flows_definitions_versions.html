<div class="description">
    This is for getting a list of all versioned flows.  So there could potentially be a lot of data here. Like if some designer guy decides to publish one hundred versions of his workflow they might all get returned here.<br>NOTE: be careful because this API does not check to see if the base flow is marked as Deleted or not.<br>You probably won't want to call this API very often, usually for situations like where the UI has a "restore a previous version of the flow" listbox.Note this uri accepts the queryParameter expand to filter users and groups (EG "expand=users", "expand=users, groups", "expand=all")

<div class="description">
    This method requires the base flow to be already created... and then (with permission) you can create a versioned flow that references it.  This method will set the meta-data of that versioned flow you're creating, and return to you a Uri of the user-upload-service where you can supply the bits of the flow definition.<br><br>There is a Process Definition File for each version of a process.  The Process Definition File contains all of the definitions for everything used by the process.  Eventually, we may support Shared Data Types, Shared Sequences, etc. that are defined in separate files, are organization-global and useable across multiple process definitions for the same organization, but such shared objects are beyond the scope of the initial release.<br><br>The Process Definition File contains Data Type Definitions, Variable Definitions, Sequence Definitions, and Actions, Outputs and Connections.<br><br>Variable Definitions can be created in process-scope or sequence-scope.  A Variable Definition always references a Data Type Definition, regardless of whether the Variable Definition is defining a basic, simple or complex variable.  ( In IPA, basic variables did not have a separate data type definition, but simple and complex variables did.)  The Data Type Definition does not indicate whether a variable is or is not a collection; that configuration is on the Variable Definition.  Variable Definitions scoped to the Process Definition or a Task Definition may be marked as Input Parameters and/or Output Parameters, but Variable Definitions scoped to a State Sequence Definition can marked as neither Input nor Output Parameters.<br><br>An Action is the smallest unit of executable.  Actions are added to Sequence Definitions, and no Action can exist outside of a Sequence Definition.  There are currently two types of Sequence Definitions: State Sequence Definitions and Task Sequence Definitions.  They are very similar, and may generally contain the same kinds of actions, with few restrictions.  A State Sequence Definition is called via a ChangeState action, cannot have input or output parameters, does not induce any Outputs onto the ChangeState action that calls the sequence, and cannot use the ExitTask action.  A Task Sequence Definition is called via the CallTaskSync action, can have input and/or output parameters, may induce Outputs onto the CallTaskSync action that calls the sequence, and can use the ExitTask action.<br><br>An Action may have zero or more Outputs, where each Output is essentially just a pointer to another Action within the same Sequence Definition via an associated Connection object.  An Action with no Outputs is a Terminating Action because it causes the current sequence to end.  Examples of terminating actions are ChangeState, ExitTask and EndProcess.  All non-terminating actions will have at least one Output.  Some actions have a fixed set of outputs (i.e. Conditional if with true/false).  Many actions will have a Default Output that is always present.  Sometimes the Default Output may be the only Output (i.e. UpdateVariables).  Sometimes Outputs get induced into an action by something the action references (i.e. RunProcessSync has a Default Output, but may also gets induced outputs due to Process End Reasons from the referenced Process Definition).<br><br>A Connection connects a specific Output of a specific Action to another Action, or even back to the same Action.  Think of Connections as the "arrows" that the server follows while the server is executing a flow: the server runs an Action; if it is a non-terminating Action, then after the action has completed the server selects an Output on that Action; once the Output is selected, the server looks for a Connection from that Output to another Action, but if there is no Connection for that output then the server exits the sequence (i.e. ExitTask(Default) if it is a Task Sequence Definition, or EndProcess(Default) if it is a State Sequence Definition).<br><br>Note:  There is no need for a Loop action.  This is because a Connection can point from an Output of an Action back to the same action, which is itself inherently a loop.<br><br><br>Page Definition JSON Guidelines<br>The following subsections list the general guides lines to follow when creating JSON objects to be include on the Process Definition File.<br><br>Keep the JSON Shallow Instead of Deep<br>There will always be some level of nesting within JSON: JSON itself always has one root object that contains everything else.  But, as a general rule, we want to keep the JSON shallow instead of deep.  This necessarily implies that fields that reference really complex objects are preferred over fields that contain really complex objects.  For example, rather than nest actions inside of actions that are also nested inside of other actions, all actions within the same sequence are defined within a single list because they are in the scope.  Then, there is another list at sequence scope that contains all of the connections between all of the actions.  Keep things shallow generally makes it easy to find the object you are looking for given it's ID, and nesting deep does not easily allow for structures like actions that connect back to another action earlier in the flow.<br><br>Mind the Well-Known Field Names<br>This file format uses several well-known field names, such as the ones below:<br>    "_meta"<br>    "id"<br>    "refId"<br>    "designer"<br>    "config"<br><br>That list of well-known field names above is not necessarily complete at this time, and will be extended as necessary.  All of the field names within that list should be discussed in this page.
<br>The well-known field names shall only be used for their intended purposes.  Other fields may contain the well known names within a substring of their entire field names. (i.e. "designer" must conform to the rules for "designer", but "myDesigner" could be used for something else.
<br>The "_meta" Field
<br>For deserialization or interpretation purposes, some objects may need a meta section to capture information such as the version of a serialization format.  When present, the field name shall be "_meta", and it shall always be the first field within the object.
<br>There is not currently a specific set of what may or may not appear in a meta object.  Each meta object will likely have the "objectType" field, which holds a string that indicates what type of data is contained by the object with the "_meta" field.  Other possible fields that may be used are "formatType" and/or "formatVersion".  The idea is that the meta object should contain any information that may be necessary for an application to know or understand the other fields that are siblings of the "_meta" field within the same object. 
<br>Generally speaking, the fields within a JSON object are allowed to be in any order, and some serializers may choose to always write the fields in alphabetic order by default.  But, it is somewhat pointless to even have the "_meta" field if it is not first since it's information could not then be used to know what to expect while deserializing the remainder of the object.  Therefore, the meta field intentionally starts with an underscore character to force it to the top if the fields get sorted during serialization.
<br>Also, it is intended that the meta can really appear within almost any object.  Basically, if a bit of extra information is is needed to understand or parse something, a "_meta" field can be added to help interpret the other fields that are siblings of the _meta field.  All "definition" objects should have a meta object that, at a minimum, indicates "objectType".
<br><br><pre>{    // This field, if present, must always be first!<br>    "_meta":<br>    {<br>        // These are some suggest field names, but may not apply in all cases<br>        "objectType": <string><br>        "formatType": <string>,<br>        "formatRevision": <version>,<br> <br>        // Could really have just about anything else here, too<br>        ....<br>    },<br> <br>    // More fields for this specific object must come after the "_meta"<br>    ...<br>}<br> <br>// Null "_meta" is allowed<br>{<br>    "_meta": null,<br>    ...<br>}<br> <br>// Empty object "_meta" is allowed<br>{<br>    "_meta: {},<br>    ...<br>}<br>// Omitted "_meta" is allowed<br>{<br>    ...<br>}</pre><br><br><br>IDs and "id" & "refId" Fields<br><br>The process definition uses IDs!!!  Think of an ID as something that uniquely identifies an object definition.  Conceptually, they are like GUIDs.  However, in reality, something a bit less verbose than GUIDs may be used.<br><br>In an attempt to more easily figure out which object owns/defines/declares the ID vs. which objects just reference the ID, the field name of all owned IDs will be "id" and the field name for all referenced IDs will be "refId".  Additionally, the "refId" shall always be inside a container object, which is intended to<br><br>    Allow for additional information that describe the scope/context in which the ID indicated by "refId" can be found, if necessary<br>    Accommodate the need to reference multiple objects from within the same parent object<br>    Eventually support the ability to reference objects defined outside of the Process Definition, such as shared Data Type Definitins or PureCloud Composer Scripts.<br><br>The field name of the "refId" container object should generally end with "Ref".<br><pre>// Object definition that is assigning an ID to itself; The "id" field does not have to be first<br>{<br>    ...,<br>    "id": <id>,<br>    ...<br>}</pre><br> <br>// Object definition that is referencing the object above via the "refId" field<br><pre>{<br>    // Container object for the "fieldOne" reference<br>    "fieldOneRef":<br>    {<br>        ...,<br> <br>        // This field indicates the ID of that other object that is being referenced<br>        "refId": <id>,<br> <br>        // If necessary, we can add additional fields that describe the scope/context in which<br>        // the object being referenced is expected to be found.<br>        ...<br>    },<br> <br>    // Since "refId" is a well-known field name but the containing object's field names are not<br>    // (i.e. "fieldOneRef" and "fieldTwoRef" are not well-known field names) the same parent object<br>    // can easily reference multiple other objects, while keeping the "refId" field name consistent.<br>    "fieldTwoRef":<br>    {<br>        ...,<br>        "refId": <id>,<br>        ...<br>    }<br>}</pre><br><br>The "identity" Field
<br>Everything about declaring the identity of the object is stored in the "identity" field.  This includes things like the "id" field, if necessary, as well as optional "name" and "description" fields in which store information entered by the user via the designer; it is unclear at this point whether the designer will or will not actually allow the user to view and/or enter a label and/or description for every major object, but the format will at least support it wherever the designer chooses to allow it!  Other information specific to certain object types, such as the revision of the Process Definition, could potentially also be stored in this object.<br><pre>{<br>    "identity":<br>    {<br>        "id":<id>,<br>        "name":string,<br>        "description":<string><br>    }<br>}</pre><br><br>Note:  The "name" and "description" fields should generally be treated as user-mutable, display only – so don't write any code to make any decisions based on a string value in "name or description"!  For example, don't look for an output named "true" on a ConditionalIf action, because it could be localized to another language, or the user may have changed it to "yes", "on", etc.<br>The "designer" Field<br><br>Any designer-specific information shall be isolated into an object under a "designer" field.  This is a well-known field name, and is intended to better faciliate the creation of a streamlined, compiled version of the process definition, etc. should the server decide that it wants to do so.  It is assumed that anything within an object used as the value for a "designer" field is not needed at runtime by the server or by clients.<br><pre>{<br>    "designer":<br>    {<br>        ...,<br>        "notes": <string>,<br>        ...<br>    }<br>}</pre><br><br>A "designer" field can occur at many levels within the JSON, and can always be ignored by the server.  As an example of something that may be added to a designer field, consider the Connections between an Action's Output an the next Action.  The server needs to know what the connection is (i.e. Action's Output points to another Action), but does not need how the connection looks when "drawn" by the user (i.e. goes up, right, down, right, etc.)<br><br>The sample JSON above shows a "notes" field in object used as the value for the "designer" field.  The "identity" section mentioned previously had "name" and "description" fields.  The idea of adding "notes" into the designer field is to allow people designing the process to add very verbose notes about design decisions, etc.  That differs from the identity.descripion, which is intended to be more of a an end-user viewable description, such as a description that assists the user to select the correct Process Definition to launch.<br>The "config" Field<br><br>Many of the objects may have a "config" field.  The contents of this field will generally be specific to the object.  This is were details about Action configuration, Variables configuration, etc. will be located.<br>The "definitions" field and Definition Lists<br><br>Many of the JSON definition objects will themselves also contain definition lists.  For example the Process Definition objects will have a Data Type Definitions list, Variable Definitions list, Sequence Definitions list, End Process Reasons List,. etc.  The Sequence Definition will have an Action Definitions List, Connection Definitions List, Exit Reasons Definitions List, etc. <br><br>When an object definition itself needs to include one or more definition lists, the object shall have a "definitions" field, and the value of that field is an object where the field names are the names of the definition lists.  Additionally, each of those field names that contains a single definition list will generally end with "Def", and every object definition within a definition list will have an "identity" field.  If the objects with a specific definition list have identity.name fields, then each of those identity.name fields shall be unique among all of the objects within that same definition list!<br>// This is a definition object.  Generally speaking, definition lists will exist within some other definition object.<br><pre>{<br>    ...,<br> <br>    // This field contains all of the definition lists,if any<br>    "definitions":<br>    {<br>        // This is the definition list for abcDef objects<br>        "abcDefs":<br>        [<br>            // Each abcDef object has an identity.id<br>            {<br>                "identity":<br>                {<br>                    "id":<id>,<br>                    "name":<string>,<br>                }<br>            },<br> <br>            // There can be any number of definition objects within this definition list,<br>            // but each of them must have a different value for identity.name.<br>            ...<br>        ],<br> <br>        // This is the definition list of xyzDef objects<br>        "xyzDefs":<br>        [<br>            // Each xyzDef object has an identity.id<br>            {<br>                "identity":<br>                {<br>                    "id":<id>,<br> <br>                    // The value of this identity.name field could be the same as a definition<br>                    // object within the "abcDefs" definition list above because the definition<br>                    // objects exist within different definition lists.<br>                    "name":<string><br>                }<br>            },<br>            ...<br>        ]<br>    },<br> <br>    ...,<br>}</pre><br>No Back-Pointers<br><br>Generally speaking, the JSON should stay away from back-pointers.  A back-pointer is a reference back to the parent object definition that has the definitions list that contains the object doing the back-pointing.  For example, a StateSequenceDefinition exists within the ProcessDefinition.definitions.stateSequenceDefs list:<br><br>    Process Definition<br>        definitions<br>            stateSequenceDefs<br>                StateSequenceDefinition<br><br> <br><br>In the example above, the JSON for the StateSeqenceDefinition should not point back to the stateSequenceDefs definitions list, or to the definitions field that contains that definitions list, or the Process Definition that contains that definitions field.  There is no need for such back-pointers because the relationship is already implied by the structure of the JSON.  With that said, however, it is likely that applications may find it useful to create such back-pointers in memory for the purpose of navigating through and manipulating the object graph; they just don't need to serialize it into the JSON.<br>Object Definition Template<br><br>Given the guidelines above, the following is kind of a template for all JSON object definitions.  For any specific definition, however, some of the sections or fields within those sections may not apply.<br><pre>{<br>    "_meta":<br>    {<br>    },<br> <br>    "identity":<br>    {<br>    },<br> <br>    // Keep in mind that the "designer" fields can really exist anywhere,<br>    // not just at the top of a definition.<br>    "designer":<br>    {<br>    },<br> <br>    "config":<br>    {<br>    },<br> <br>    "definitions":<br>    {<br>    }<br>}</pre><br>
